# Episode Finder

This project is the backend of an 'episode finder' app, built as a learning project with React and Rails 5.

[The front-end repo](https://github.com/Obversity/what-episode-rails)

Season / episode data is being scraped from imdb, but the app is useless on its own without question data to go with episodes, so running the app locally won't get you much. I may attempt to crowdsource questions when I'm happy with it feature-wise and code-wise.
