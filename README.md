# Episode Finder

This project is the backend of an 'episode finder' app, built as a learning project with React and Rails 5.

[The front-end repo](https://github.com/Obversity/what-episode-rails)

It's using http://www.omdbapi.com to fetch season / episode data for shows, and the API is sometimes unreliable.

The app is useless on its own without question data to go with episodes, so running the app locally won't get you much. I may host it eventually   and crowdsource questions when I'm happy with it feature-wise and code-wise.
